  abstract = {Koiter's asymptotic method enables the calculation and deep understanding of the initial post-buckling behaviour of thin-walled structures. For the single-mode asymptotic analysis, Budiansky (1974) presented a clear and general formulation for Koiter's method, based on the expansion of the total potential energy function. The formulation from Budiansky is herein revisited and expanded for the multi-modal asymptotic analysis, of primordial importance in structures with clustered bifurcation modes. Given the admittedly difficult implementation of Koiter's method, especially for multi-modal analysis and during the evaluation of the third\textendash{} and fourth\textendash order tensors involved in Koiter's analysis; the presented study proposes a formulation and notation with close correspondence with the implemented algorithms. The implementation is based on state-of-the-art collaborative tools: Python, NumPy and Cython. The kinematic relations are specialized using von K\'arm\'an shell kinematics, and the displacement field variables are approximated using an enhanced Bogner-Fox-Schmit (BFS) finite element, modified to reach third-order interpolation also for the in-plane displacements, using only 4 nodes per element and 10 degrees-of-freedom per node, aiming an accurate representation of the second-order fields. The formulation and implementation are verified by comparing results for isotropic and composite plates against established literature. Finally, results for multi-modal displacement fields with up to 5 modes and corresponding post-buckling factors are reported for future reference.},

Our experiments reveal the formation of hexagonal patterns through a discontinuous transition. As the unbuckled state is transversely isotropic, a continuum of linear modes become critical at the first bifurcation load: the critical wavevectors form a circle contained in a horizontal plane. Using a weakly non-linear post-bifurcation expansion, we investigate how these linear modes cooperate to produce buckling patterns: by a mechanism documented in other transversely isotropic structures, three-modes coupling make the unbuckled configuration unstable with respect to hexagonal patterns by a transcritical bifurcation. Stripe and square patterns are solutions of the post-bifurcation expansion as well but they are unstable near the threshold. These analytical results are confirmed and complemented by numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {The Koiter method recovers the equilibrium path of an elastic structure using a reduced model, obtained by means of a quadratic asymptotic expansion of the finite element model. Its main feature is the possibility of efficiently performing sensitivity analysis by including a-posteriori the effects of the imperfections in the reduced non-linear equations. The state-of-art treatment of geometrical imperfections is accurate only for small imperfection amplitudes and linear pre-critical behavior. This work enlarges the validity of the method to a wider range of practical problems through a new approach, which accurately takes into account the imperfection without losing the benefits of the a-posteriori treatment. A mixed solid-shell finite element is used to build the discrete model. A large number of numerical tests, regarding non-linear buckling problems, modal interaction, unstable post-critical and imperfection sensitive structures, validates the proposal.

  abstract = {The multi-modal Koiter method is a reduction technique for estimating quickly the nonlinear buckling response of structures under mechanical loads requiring a fine discretization. The reduced model is based on a quadratic approximation of the full model using a few linear buckling modes and their second order corrections, followed by the projection of the equilibrium equations onto the modal subspace. In this article, the method is reformulated for geometrically nonlinear thermoelastic analyses of shell structures. The starting point is an isogeometric solid-shell discretization with an accurate modeling of thermal strains, temperature-dependent materials and general temperature distributions. The equilibrium path is defined as a displacement versus temperature amplifier curve, while mechanical loads are kept constant. The strain energy nonlinearity with respect to the temperature amplifier is the main obstacle in the definition of an accurate reduced model. This task is achieved by coherent asymptotic expansions in mixed form using independent stress variables at the integration points and accurate linear buckling modes obtained by a two-point mixed eigenvalue problem. Structures made of isotropic and multi-layered composite materials, including variable angle tow laminates, are considered to show the accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {An efficient continuation method is proposed for a direct sensitivity analysis of the critical point to geometrical imperfections, e.g. expressed as combination of given shapes, for thin-walled structures prone to buckling. After a finite element discretization, the critical point is defined by a system of nonlinear algebraic equations imposing equilibrium and critical condition according to the null vector method. An arc-length equation is added to follow a path of critical points in the imperfection space. Remarkable novelties are achieved. Firstly, the Jacobian of the extended system is entirely computed analytically by means of a solid-shell model and a strain-based modeling of the geometrical deviation. Moreover, a mixed scheme with independent element-wise stress variables is devised for a more efficient and robust iterative solution compared to the standard null vector method. The mixed algorithm speeds up the sensitivity analysis allowing larger imperfection steps and much fewer factorizations of the condensed stiffness matrix, only one per imperfection in its modified version with constant matrix over the step. Finally, the critical point derivatives with respect to the imperfection parameters are also obtained analytically and can be used to generate a gradient-based critical path for a quick search of the worst-case imperfection.},

  abstract = {We consider creases and folds in compressed hyperelastic solids from the point of view of bifurcation theory. They refer to highly localized surface deformations that occur at compressive loads significantly below the value of the well-known Biot instability. Much work from the literature attempts to make the case that this phenomenon corresponds to a ``local bifurcation'' distinct from the Biot instability. A local bifurcation is a path of equilibrium solutions emanating from a (bifurcation) point on the trivial solution branch that exists in all sufficiently small neighborhoods of that bifurcation point. The inference is usually made by first introducing a small surface imperfection; a solution curve is then obtained that is seemingly close to a perfect bifurcation diagram. However, imperfection theory is valid only in some sufficiently small neighborhood of a bifurcation point. Thus, in the absence of an equilibrium path connecting these solutions to the trivial one, there is no justification for concluding that creasing and folding are local bifurcations of the perfect system. In this work, we directly address the nucleation of these solutions in the perfect, imperfection-free case. We demonstrate that surface instabilities in functionally graded and bilayer elastic halfspaces, corresponding to local bifurcations from the homogeneous state, are necessarily smooth and oscillatory; creases/folds eventually do develop along the global bifurcating solution branches, albeit ``far'' from the trivial solution, as evidenced by the corresponding bifurcation diagrams. In addition, we find that their stable realization occurs at load levels well below that of the initial surface instability. Moreover, we obtain such results for the perfect homogeneous halfspace, by switching the continuation parameter from macroscopic lateral strain to the film-to-substrate shear modulus ratio. When this ratio reaches unity, we obtain the desired localized deformation solution, avoiding the need for analysis near the highly degenerate homogeneous state at the Biot instability.},

The two-bar planar truss considered involves standard structural and material behavior models which are incorporated in many structural analysis codes, and it can be made to mimic a wide-variety of types of behavior. Concrete examples of behavior which could cause computational difficulties in the numerical analysis of more complex structural models are valuable in the process of developing and improving solution algorithms for nonlinear structural analysis.},

Here this methodology is generalized to include nonlinear prebuckling behavior, as well as multiple, not necessarily coincident buckling modes. The expansion of the reduced equilibrium equations is performed about a reference point (which need not coincide with any of the bifurcation points), and applies no matter whether the modes are coincident, closely spaced, or well separated. From a variety of possible decompositions of the admissible space of displacements, two are incorporated into a finite element program. Theoretical considerations, and numerical examples in which asymptotic results are compared to `exact' results, indicate that one of the decompositions has some important advantages over the other. Examples include a shallow arch, and a beam on elastic foundation problem exhibiting symmetry-breaking modal interaction.},

It is shown that, as a consequence of the geometry of the structure, the system can undergo three buckling modes which are asymmetric in-plane buckling, symmetric out-of-plane buckling and asymmetric out-of-plane buckling. The analysis takes into account the influence of local buckling and yielding of bars on global instabilities. The Green\textendash Lagrange strain is adopted as the strain measure and the theorem of the stationarity of the total potential energy is employed to derive the nonlinear equilibrium equations. The tangent stiffness matrix is derived and, through the solution of the eigenvalue problem, the stability of the equilibrium solutions is investigated. Analytical formulations for the instabilities of the truss are presented. For the numerical approach, a linear elastic constitutive model is assumed for the uniaxial stress\textendash strain relationship of the truss bars. To take into account the yielding of bar elements, a perfect elastoplastic model is assumed. A computer program was developed in Fortran to perform comparisons with the results of the theoretical formulation. Finally, the numerical results obtained demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the presented truss element. The main novelty of this paper is the introduction of an additional DOF in the Mises truss which allows to study a more complex scenario of equilibrium paths and instabilities.},

  abstract = {Due to the high specific strength and stiffness, thin-walled shells are widely used in aerospace engineering structures. However, along with the increase of the structure size or the structure hierarchy, the computational cost of the post-buckling analysis of thin-walled shells would increase sharply and then the imperfection sensitivity analysis would become time-consuming. In this study, an accelerated Koiter method is proposed to improve the efficiency of post-buckling analysis and imperfection sensitivity analysis of thin-walled shells under axial compression. In the framework of the accelerated Koiter method, a single mode Koiter method considering pre-buckling nonlinear behavior is used to reduce the computational time of repeated imperfection analysis, which can accurately predict the effect of the small amplitude imperfection. Furthermore, in order to obtain the expanded point of Koiter method, a Combined Approximation (CA)-based iterative eigenvalue algorithm is constructed to obtain the pre-buckling state in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point and reduce computational cost by the reasonable step length prediction. Finally, the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated by means of four illustrative examples, including the composite cylindrical shell, the isotropic cylindrical shell, the isotropic conical shell and the hierarchical stiffened cylindrical shell under axial compression.},
