The space of admissible states of the system under consideration is denoted $U$. It has the structure of a real
vector space. The energy of the system is $\E(u, \lambda)$, where $\lambda$ denotes a loading parameter. It
is assumed that the fundamental branch of the equilibrium diagram, $u^\ast(\lambda)$ is known. Then the energy is
stationary with respect to the state $u$ along the whole branch. In other words, for all $\hat{u} \in U$

$$
\E_{,u}[u^{\ast}(\lambda), \lambda; \hat{u}]=0,
$${#eq-20221227184138}

where $\E_{,u}(u, \lambda; \hat{u})$ denotes the (real) value of the differential of the energy $\E$ with
respect to the state $u$, evaluated at $(u, \lambda)$, for the test function $\hat{u}$. Similarly,
evaluation of the second-, third-, etc., order differential of the energy will be denoted $\E_{,uu}(u, \lambda; \hat{u}, \hat{v})$,
$\E_{,uuu}(u, \lambda; \hat{u}, \hat{v}, \hat{w})$, etc. It is assumed that a finite value
$\lambda_0 > 0$ of $\lambda$ can be found (critical load), such that

1. $\E_{,uu}[u(\lambda), \lambda] > 0$ for all $0 < \lambda < \lambda_0$,
2. $\E_{,uu}(u_0, \lambda_0) \geq 0$ but $\E_{,uu}(u_0, \lambda_0) \ngtr 0$,
3. $\E_{,uu}[u(\lambda), \lambda] < 0$ for $\lambda > \lambda_0$, close enough to $\lambda_0$.

We introduce the following notations

$$
u_0 = u^\ast(\lambda_0), \quad \dot{u}_0 = \frac{\D u^\ast}{\D \lambda} \biggr \rvert_{\lambda=\lambda_0}, \quad \ddot{u}_0 = \frac{\D^2 u^\ast}{\D \lambda^2} \biggr \rvert_{\lambda=\lambda_0}, \quad \dddot{u}_0 = \ldots, \quad \ddddot{u}_0 = \ldots
$$

and

$$
\E_2 = \E_{,uu}(u_0, \lambda_0), \quad \E_3 = \E_{,uuu}(u_0, \lambda_0), \quad \E_4 = \E_{,uuuu}(u_0, \lambda_0).
$$

Note that $\E_2$, $\E_3$ and $\E_4$ thus defined are bi-, tri- and quadrilinear forms, respectively. The following
derivatives are also introduced

$$
\dot{\E}_2(\hat{u}, \hat{v}) = \frac{\D}{\D\lambda} \E_{,uu}[ u^\ast(\lambda), \lambda; \hat{u}, \hat{v}] \biggr \rvert_{\lambda = \lambda_0}
= \E_{,uuu}(u_0, \lambda_0; \dot{u}_0, \hat{u}, \hat{v}) + \E_{,uu\lambda}(u_0, \lambda_0; \hat{u}, \hat{v})
$${#eq-20221227184821}

$$
  \begin{aligned}[b]
    \ddot{\E}_2(\hat{u}, \hat{v}) = \frac{\D^2}{\D\lambda^2} \E_{,uu}[ u^\ast(\lambda), \lambda; \hat{u}, \hat{v}] \biggr \rvert_{\lambda = \lambda_0}
	={} & \E_{,uuuu}(u_0, \lambda_0; \dot{u}_0, \dot{u}_0, \hat{u}, \hat{v}) + 2\E_{,uuu\lambda}(u_0, \lambda_0; \dot{u}_0, \hat{u}, \hat{v})\\
    & + \E_{,uu\lambda\lambda}( u_0, \lambda_0; \hat{u}, \hat{v}) + \E_{,uuu}(u_0, \lambda_0, \ddot{u}_0),
  \end{aligned}
$$

and, similarly, $\dot{\E}_3$, $\ddot{\E}_3$, etc.

The load $\lambda_0$ will be referred to as the *critical load*; similarly, the state $u_0$ of the system
at the critical load will be referred to as the *critical state*; finally, the pair $(u_0, \lambda_0)$ is the
*critical point* of the system. Assumption 1 implies that equilibria along the fundamental branch are *stable below the
critical load*. Conversely, it results from assumption 3 that equilibrium points on the fundamental branch are *unstable
above the critical load*. Stability at the critical load is yet undetermined.

The goal of these notes is to analyze *all* equilibrium paths that pass through the critical point $(u_0, \lambda_0)$.
