  abstract = {A general theory of elastic stability is presented. In contrast to previous work in the field, the present analysis is augmented by an investigation of the behavior of the buckled structure in the immediate neighborhood of the bifurcation point. This investigation explains why some structures, e.g., a flate plate supported along its edges and subjected to thrust in its plane, are capable of carrying loads considerably above the buckling load, while other structures, e.g., an axially loaded cylindrical shell, collapse at loads far below the theoretical critical load.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the elastic postbuckling theory, but we introduce two modifications with respect to its classical statement. First, we account for the influence of symmetries. Second, the singularities will be classified according to their robustness, what was introduced by Catastrophe Theory. Various recent progresses are discussed ; mathematical foundations of the energy criterion, buckling of structures with a large aspect ratio, contribution of catastrophe theory ...},
