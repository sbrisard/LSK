  abstract = {We investigate the non-linear buckling patterns produced by the elastic Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a hyper-elastic slab hanging below a rigid horizontal plane, using a combination of experiments, weakly non-linear expansions and numerical simulations. Our experiments reveal the formation of hexagonal patterns through a discontinuous transition. As the unbuckled state is transversely isotropic, a continuum of linear modes become critical at the first bifurcation load: the critical wavevectors form a circle contained in a horizontal plane. Using a weakly non-linear post-bifurcation expansion, we investigate how these linear modes cooperate to produce buckling patterns: by a mechanism documented in other transversely isotropic structures, three-modes coupling make the unbuckled configuration unstable with respect to hexagonal patterns by a transcritical bifurcation. Stripe and square patterns are solutions of the post-bifurcation expansion as well but they are unstable near the threshold. These analytical results are confirmed and complemented by numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {A general theory of elastic stability is presented. In contrast to previous work in the field, the present analysis is augmented by an investigation of the behavior of the buckled structure in the immediate neighborhood of the bifurcation point. This investigation explains why some structures, e.g., a flate plate supported along its edges and subjected to thrust in its plane, are capable of carrying loads considerably above the buckling load, while other structures, e.g., an axially loaded cylindrical shell, collapse at loads far below the theoretical critical load.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the elastic postbuckling theory, but we introduce two modifications with respect to its classical statement. First, we account for the influence of symmetries. Second, the singularities will be classified according to their robustness, what was introduced by Catastrophe Theory. Various recent progresses are discussed ; mathematical foundations of the energy criterion, buckling of structures with a large aspect ratio, contribution of catastrophe theory ...},
