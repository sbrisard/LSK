# Foreword

These are my notes on the LSK method for the analysis of the stability and
bifurcation(s) of a conservative system. These notes are based on several
references: Koiter's initial PhD thesis {cite}`koit1945` as well as some
graphical illustrations from his lecture notes {cite}`koit2009`. I enjoyed the
concise presentation of {cite}`nguy2000` as well as the lecture notes of
{cite}`tria2017`. Finally, the chapter by {cite}`poti1987` helped me clear some
issues.

I hope the reader will find these notes useful, even though there are still a
few points which I do not fully understand (they are clearly indicated in the
text).
