# Welcome!

These are my notes on the LSK method for the analysis of the stability and bifurcation(s) of a conservative
system. These notes are based on several references: the initial PhD thesis of @koit1945 as well as some graphical
illustrations from his lecture notes [@koit2009]. I enjoyed the concise presentation of @nguy2000 as well as the lecture
notes of @tria2017. Finally, the chapter by @poti1987 helped me clear some issues.

I hope the reader will find these notes useful, even though there are still a few points which I do not fully understand
(they are clearly indicated in the text).
