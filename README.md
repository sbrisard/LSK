# Notes on the Lyapunov–Schmidt–Koiter asymptotic method

This repository hosts the sources of my *Notes on the Lyapunov–Schmidt–Koiter asymptotic method* for the analysis of the
stability and bifurcation(s) of a conservative system. These notes are based on several references: the initial PhD
thesis of [Koiter (1945)]() as well as some graphical illustrations from his lecture notes [(Koiter,
2009)](https://imechanica.org/files/Koiter%20AFFDLTR70-025.pdf). I enjoyed the concise presentation of
[Nguyen](https://doi.org/10.1080/12795119.2000.9692281) as well as the lecture notes of [Triantafyllidis
(2017)](). Finally, the chapter by [Potier-Ferry (1987)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0009197) helped me clear some
issues.

I hope the reader will find these notes useful, even though there are still a few points which I do not fully understand
(they are clearly indicated in the text).
